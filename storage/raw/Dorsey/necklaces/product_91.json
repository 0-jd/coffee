    "\n        A Dorsey staple, the 4-prong Kate necklace is an easy go-to layering piece. Now available in 3MM lab-grown white sapphires for a daintier look than our Kate necklace (which is 3.75 MM), Moss is set with fine jewelry integrity and clasped securely with double safety hooks. Put it on, leave it on, and wear it with everything.\n      "
