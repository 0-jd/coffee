So they have the same physical and chemical properties as mined stones but without harm caused to the environment or those who mine for them.\nLab-grown gemstones are more affordable than mined gemstones but the quality, sparkle, and timelessness factor remain the same. This is the future of beautiful jewelry.\nLab-grown diamond expressed in Carat Total Weight (CTW). Lab-grown sapphire and emerald CTW expressed in Diamond Equivalent Weight.\n              ",
