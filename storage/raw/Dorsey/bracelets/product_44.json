Orders placed after this date cannot be guaranteed to arrive in time for the holidays. \nThe classic ID bracelet. \nDorsey ID is a tangible reminder of people or milestones in your life that mean something to you. Engraving can be simple (your mom's name, your daughter’s birthday, or another moment in time you will keep with you forever), or perhaps it’s more veiled (the nickname your brothers gave you growing up or the date you finally decided to take a leap of faith into the unknown). There’s always a story to tell. \nRendered in sterling silver, a paperclip chain means the length can be adjusted to your preferred fit. We've been known to layer our ID with the Leonora bracelet and the Kate rivière bracelet.\nGift Ideas:\nIs this a gift? Here's what to do: engrave later. Choose an ID and send it back to us at any time for custom engraving — on us. Email VIP@shopdorsey.com.\n\n      "
