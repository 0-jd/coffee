    "\n        Our 5-row, pavé lab-grown white sapphire bracelet sits gracefully atop the wrist - but don’t be deceived - the Bendetta bracelet is anything but dainty. Inspired by the gold link sets of the 1930’s, she can be styled alone or loaded up with our Dorsey and Kate rivière bracelets (shown here).  \n      "
